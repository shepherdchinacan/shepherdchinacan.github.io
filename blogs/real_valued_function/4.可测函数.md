# Lebesgue Measurable Functions

A function $f(x)$ defined on a measurable set $E$ is called **Lebesgue measurable**, or simply a measurable function, if for any real number $a$, the set $E[f(x) > a]$ is a measurable set.

The following statements are equivalent:

- $f(x)$ is a measurable function on $E$
- For any real number $a$, $E[f(x) \geq a]$ is a measurable set
- For any real number $a$, $E[f(x) < a]$ is a measurable set
- For any real number $a$, $E[f(x) \leq a]$ is a measurable set

---

Given the **Dirichlet function** $D(x)$ on the interval $R^1 = (0,1)$, which takes the value 1 at rational points and 0 at irrational points:

$$
D(x) = \begin{cases}
1, & x \text{ is rational} \\
0, & x \text{ is irrational}
\end{cases}
$$

For any real number $a$, we have:

$$
E[D(x) > a] = \begin{cases}
\emptyset, & a \geq 1 \\
Q^1, & 0 \leq a < 1 \\
R^1, & a < 0
\end{cases}
$$

Since $\emptyset, Q^1, R^1$ are all measurable sets, $D(x)$ is a measurable function. The conclusion is: Continuous functions are always measurable, but measurable functions are not necessarily continuous, and they can even be discontinuous everywhere.

> $Q^1$ represents the rational numbers in the interval $(0,1)$, which is also a measurable set. This is because the measure of the rational numbers in $(0,1)$ is 0, while the measure of the irrational numbers is 1.

# Properties of Measurable Functions

- If $f(x)$ is a measurable function on a measurable set $E$ and $E_1 \subset E$ is a measurable subset of $E$, then $f(x)$ is also a measurable function on $E_1$.
- If $f(x)$ is measurable on each measurable set $E_i(i=1,2,\dots,m,m \text{ finite or } +\infty)$, then $f(x)$ is also measurable on $E = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i$.
- If $\{f_n(x)\}$ is a sequence of measurable functions on $E$, then $\sup_n\{f_n(x)\}$ and $\inf_n\{f_n(x)\}$ are also measurable functions on $E$ [This is because the space of measurable functions is complete, addressing the incompleteness issue in the space of Riemann integrable functions].

Let there be a proposition $P(x)$ regarding points $x$ in set $E$. If there is a subset $N$ of $E$ with $m(N)=0$ (measure zero), such that $P(x)$ holds for all $x \in E\setminus N$, then we say that $P(x)$ holds **a.e.** on $E$.

> a.e. means **almost everywhere**

## Operations on Measurable Functions

Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be measurable functions on $E$, then:

- For any real number $c$, $cf(x)$ is a measurable function on $E$.
- When $f(x) + g(x)$ is defined almost everywhere on $E$, $f(x) + g(x)$ is a measurable function on $E$.
- When $f(x) \cdot g(x)$ is defined almost everywhere on $E$, $f(x) \cdot g(x)$ is a measurable function on $E$.
- When $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ is defined almost everywhere on $E$, $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ is a measurable function on $E$.

Let $\{f_n(x)\}$ be a sequence of measurable functions on $E$ and $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) = f(x) \text{ a.e. on } E$, then $f(x)$ is also a measurable function on $E$.

# Simple Functions

Let $E$ be a measurable set, and $\phi(x)$ be a function on $E$. If $E$ can be decomposed into the union of finitely many disjoint measurable subsets: $E = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} E_i$, and $\phi(x)$ takes a constant value $C_i$ on each $E_i$, then $\phi(x)$ is called a **simple function** on $E$.

- Simple functions are measurable functions.
- The Dirichlet function is a simple function.
- The sum, difference, and product of simple functions are still simple functions.
- If $f(x)$ is a measurable function on $E$, then there exists a sequence of simple functions $\{\phi_n(x)\}$ on $E$ such that:

$$
f(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \phi_n(x)
$$

# Convergence in Measure

Let $\{f_n(x)\}$ be a sequence of measurable functions on a point set $E$, and $f(x)$ be a measurable function on $E$. If for any $\epsilon > 0$, we have:

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} m(E[|f_n(x) - f(x)| > \epsilon]) = 0
$$

Then we say that the sequence $\{f_n(x)\}$ **converges in measure** to $f(x)$ on $E$, denoted as $f_n(x) \xrightarrow{m} f(x)$.

Alternatively, it can be expressed as: For any $\epsilon > 0$ and any $\delta > 0$, there exists a natural number $N$, such that when $n \geq N$, we have:

$$
m(E[|f_n(x) - f(x)| > \epsilon]) < \delta
$$

In probability theory, by replacing the measure function $m(E)$ with a probability function $p(x)$, we obtain **convergence in probability**.

## Relationship Between Convergence in Measure and Almost Everywhere Convergence

- **Riesz Theorem (F. Riesz)**: Let $\{f_n(x)\}$ be a sequence of measurable functions that converges in measure to $f(x)$ on $E$. Then there exists a subsequence $\{f_{n_k}(x)\}$ such that:

$$
\lim_{k \to \infty} f_{n_k}(x) = f(x) \quad \text{a.e. on } E
$$

- If the sequence $\{f_n(x)\}$ converges to $f(x)$ almost everywhere on $E$, and $m(E) < \infty$, then $\{f_n(x)\}$ must converge in measure to $f(x)$ on $E$.
