# Distance Between Sets
Let $A$ and $B$ be non-empty point sets in $R^n$. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is defined as $d(A, B) = \inf \{d(x, y) | x \in A, y \in B\}$. We call $d(x, B)$ the distance between point $x$ and set $B$, i.e., $d(x, B) = d(\{x\}, B) = \inf \{d(x, y) | y \in B\}$.

Here are two important points to note:
- For any two non-empty sets $A$ and $B$, we always have $d(A, B) \geq 0$.
- If $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$, then $d(A, B) = 0$; however, $d(A, B) = 0$ does not necessarily imply that $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$.

For example, let $A=(1,2)$ and $B=(2,3)$, then $A \cap B=\emptyset$ but $d(A, B)=0$.

# Upper and Lower Limits of Sets 上限集和下限集
Let $A_1, A_2, A_3, \dots, A_n, \dots$ be any sequence of sets, denoted as the set sequence[集列] $\{A_n\}$. The set consisting of elements that belong to infinitely many sets in the sequence is called the **upper limit** of this sequence, denoted as $\bar{\lim}_{n \rightarrow \infty} A_{n}$ or $\lim_{n} \sup A_{n}$. The set consisting of elements $x$ that belong to all sets $A_n$ after a certain index $n_0(x)$ (i.e., the set of elements contained in all sets except for finitely many) is called the **lower limit** of the sequence, denoted as $\underline{\lim}_{n \rightarrow \infty} A_{n}$ or $\lim_{n} \inf A_{n}$.

$$
\text{Upper limit set} = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} \bigcup_{m=n}^{\infty} A_m, \quad \text{Lower limit set} = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \bigcap_{m=n}^{\infty} A_m
$$

Alternatively, this can be written as:

$$
\text{Upper limit set} = \{x | \text{there are infinitely many } A_n \text{ such that } x \in A_n\}
$$

$$
\text{Lower limit set} = \{x | \text{there exists } N(x), \text{ such that for } n > N(x), x \in A_n\}
$$
Clearly, we have:

$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \subset \underline{\lim}_{n \rightarrow \infty} A_{n} \subset \bar{\lim}_{n \rightarrow \infty} A_{n} \subset \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n
$$

If the upper and lower limits of the set sequence $\{A_n\}$ are equal, then we say that the sequence $\{A_n\}$ converges, and we denote:

$$
A = \lim_{n \to \infty} A_n = \lim \sup_{n \to \infty} A_n = \lim \inf_{n \to \infty} A_n
$$

as the limit of the set sequence $\{A_n\}$, written as $A = \lim_{n \to \infty} A_n$.

# Algebra and Ring
Let $X$ be a given set, also called the **base space**. A collection of subsets of $X$ is called 集族或集类或集合系，也简称为类.

Let $X$ be a set, and let $R$ be a family of sets on $X$. If for any $E_1, E_2 \in R$, we have $E_1 \cup E_2 \in R$ and $E_1 - E_2 \in R$, then $R$ is called a **ring** on $X$. Particularly, if $X \in R$, then $R$ is called an **algebra** on $X$, or also a **field**.

A ring (or algebra or field) is closed under union and difference operations, and it is also closed under intersection, because intersection can be expressed through union and difference:

$$
E_1 \cap E_2 = (E_1 \cup E_2) - (E_1 - E_2) - (E_2 - E_1)
$$

# Sigma-Algebra

Let $S$ be a family of sets composed of some subsets of $X$. If for any sequence $E_i \in S (i = 1,2,3, \dots)$ we have $\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i \in S$ and $E_1 - E_2 \in S$, then $S$ is called a **σ-ring** on $X$. If $X \in S$, it is called a **σ-algebra** or **σ-field** on $X$.

For countable sets[可数集], we also have:

$$
\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i - \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} \left(\bigcup_{j=1}^{\infty} (E_j - E_i)\right)
$$

> The main difference between an algebra and a σ-algebra is that the former is closed under finite unions and intersections, while the latter is closed under countable (infinite) unions and intersections.

Let $E$ be a family of sets composed of some subsets of $X$. Then, there exists a unique **σ-ring** (or **σ-algebra**) $S$ such that:

1. $E \subset S$
2. For any σ-ring (or σ-algebra) $S_1$ that contains $E$, we have $S \subset S_1$.

This theorem shows that any σ-ring or σ-algebra has a minimal σ-ring or σ-algebra, and the same applies to algebras or rings.

**A simple explanation of a σ-algebra:**

1. **Set family**: We can think of a set family as a "box" that contains a specific collection of sets. For example, a set family might contain sets like "the set of all even numbers" or "the set of all numbers less than 10".

2. **Three rules of σ-algebra**:

   To be a **σ-algebra**, the sets in this "box" must satisfy the following three conditions:

   • **Union rule**: If you take some sets from the box (even infinitely many), their union (the set formed by combining all their elements) must also be in the box.

   • **Difference rule**: If there are two sets in the box, you can subtract one set from the other (find the difference), and the resulting set must also be in the box.

   • **Universal set rule**: The box must contain the universal set (e.g., "the set of all numbers"), and it must also contain the complement of this universal set (i.e., "everything outside the universal set").

3. **Simple analogy**:

   A σ-algebra can be thought of as a "self-contained system". Any set in this system that undergoes various operations (union, difference, complement) will result in a new set that remains within the system.

**Why is a σ-algebra important?**

σ-algebras are crucial in mathematics, especially in **probability theory** and **measure theory**. For example, in probability theory, we often use a σ-algebra to define the collection of events for which we can compute probabilities. A σ-algebra ensures that after performing various combinations, additions, or subtractions of events, the result remains within the scope of our study and can still be measured and analyzed.

# Covering Theorems 覆盖定理

The union of any number of open sets is still an open set, and the intersection of finitely many open sets is still an open set. Similarly, the intersection of any number of closed sets is still a closed set, and the union of finitely many closed sets is still a closed set. However, **the intersection of infinitely many open sets may not be open**, and **the union of infinitely many closed sets may not be closed**.

For example:
The intersection of infinitely many open sets might result in a closed set. Consider $A_n = \left(-\frac{1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}\right)$, then $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n = \{0\}$, which is a closed set. The union of infinitely many closed sets may not be closed. Consider $A_n = [-1 + \frac{1}{n}, 2 - \frac{1}{n}]$, then $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n = (-1,2)$, which is an open set.

Let $E$ be a point set in $R^n$, and let $\{G_\lambda\}_{\lambda \in I}$ be a family of open sets in $R^n$. If for every point $P \in E$, there exists an open set $G_\lambda \in \{G_\lambda\}$ such that $P \in G_\lambda$, then we say that the family of open sets $\{G_\lambda\}_{\lambda \in I}$ is an **open cover** of $E$, or simply a **cover**.

**Borel's Finite Covering Theorem 有限覆盖定理**: Let $F$ be a bounded closed set, and let $\{G_\lambda\}_{\lambda \in I}$ be any open cover of $F$. Then, there exists a finite number of open sets $G_1, G_2, \dots, G_m$ that also cover $F$.
> In Borel’s finite covering theorem, $F$ must be both "bounded" and "closed". If these two conditions are not met, the theorem would change.

**Lindelöf's 林德略夫 Countable Covering Theorem**: Let $E$ be any point set in $R^n$, and let a family of open sets $A$ cover $E$. Then, there exists a countable (or finite) subfamily of open sets that also covers $E$.

# Borel Set
In real analysis or measure theory, a **Borel set** is a set generated by open sets of the real through countable intersections, unions, and complements. It is the smallest **σ-algebra** generated by the open sets in a topological space. The construction of Borel sets follows these steps:

1. Use all open sets as the construction base.
2. If a set belongs to $\mathcal{B}(R)$, then its complement also belongs to $\mathcal{B}(R)$.
3. If the sequence of sets $\{A_n\}$ belongs to $\mathcal{B}(R)$, then both their countable union $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$ and countable intersection $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$ also belong to $\mathcal{B}(R)$.

All open sets, closed sets, and intervals (including $(a,b)$, $(a,b]$, $[a,b)$, $[a,b]$) are Borel sets. Borel sets are closed under complement, countable unions, and countable intersections. Measurable sets, probability spaces, random variables, and event spaces are all defined on Borel sets. Borel sets are actually very "large" and can be thought of as containing almost all "well-behaved" sets.

<span style="background:#fff88f">If you encounter the term "Borel set" in papers or materials, unless the requirements are strict, you can safely ignore the word "Borel" and think of the set as just a general set.</span>
