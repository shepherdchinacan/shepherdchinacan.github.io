# Intuitively Understanding Measure
**Measure**: A generalization and abstraction of 1D length, 2D area, and 3D volume to sets in $n$-dimensional space.

Let the point set $I = \{x | x = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n), a_i < x_i < b_i, i = 1, 2, \dots, n\}$ be an open interval in $R^n$. Similarly, if $a_i < x_i \leq b_i$, it is called a left semi-open interval, and $a_i \leq x_i < b_i$ is called a right semi-open interval. If $I$ is an interval, we call $|I|$ the volume of interval $I$:

$$
|I| = \prod_{i=1}^{n}(b_i - a_i) = (b_1 - a_1) \times (b_2 - a_2) \times \dots \times (b_n - a_n)
$$

The concept of volume is still quite specific, requiring each dimension to take values within a continuous interval and being independent across dimensions. We need to further extend the concept of volume to general point sets.

Based on experience in 3D space, an abstract measure should also possess the following properties:
1. The measure of the empty set equals 0.
2. The measure of any set is non-negative.
3. The measure of two disjoint sets equals the sum of their respective measures.

# Definition of Measure

Define $\hat{R} = R \cup \{+\infty\} \cup \{-\infty\}$. Let $E$ be a family of sets, and if $\mu$ is a mapping from $E$ to $\hat{R}$, we say that $\mu$ is a **set function 集函数**.

> Therefore, a set function takes sets as its arguments and outputs real numbers, including positive and negative infinity.

Let $R$ be a ring composed of some subsets of set $X$, and $\mu$ be a set function on $R$. If $\mu$ has the following properties, it is called a **measure** on ring $R$, and $\mu(E)$ is the **measure** of set $E$:

1. $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$
2. **Non-negativity**: For any $E \in R$, $\mu(E) \geq 0$
3. **Countable additivity**: For any sequence of sets $E_i \in R (i = 1,2,3,\dots)$, if $E_i \cap E_j = \emptyset (i \neq j)$ and $\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i \in R$, then we must have:

$$
\mu\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \mu(E_i)
$$

We can trivially define $\mu(E_i) = \infty$ for all non-empty sets, which still satisfies the definition of measure. However, such a measure is meaningless, trivial. Typically, the measure is non-negative, countably additive, and has at least some finite values for subsets.

The function $\mu(E)$, representing the number of elements in $E$ (where $E \in R$), is a valid measure. The reason we define measures on a ring is due to the good structure and properties of rings, which are closed under union, difference, and intersection, corresponding to the sum and difference of measures. In fact, the concept of measure can also be extended to more general systems of sets.


# Outer Measure

Let $X$ be the base space, and $R$ a ring of $X$. Now we introduce a **σ-ring** (as opposed to a ring, a σ-ring is closed under countable unions). $H(R)$ denotes the set of all subsets of $X$ that can be covered by a sequence of elements from $R$, i.e.,

$$
H(R) = \{E | E \subset X, \text{there exists} E_i \in R(i=1,2,3,\dots) \text{such that} E \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i\}
$$

Note: For any ring $R$, it always holds that $R \subset H(R)$.

If $\mu$ is a measure on ring $R$, we define a set function $\mu^*$ on $H(R)$: for any $E \in H(R)$, $\mu^*$ is called the **outer measure** induced by measure $\mu$:

$$
\mu^*(E) = \inf\left\{\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \mu(E_i) | E_i \in R ，\text{and}， E \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i\right\}
$$

> The outer measure represents covering a set with a collection of sets, and the infimum of the sum of the measures of this collection is the outer measure of the covered set. Note that we have only defined $\mu^*$ as the outer measure on $R$, but $\mu^*$ may not necessarily be a measure on $H(R)$.

Let $E$ be any point set in $R^n$. For any countable collection of open intervals $I_1, I_2, \dots, I_n, \dots$ such that $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} I_n \supset E$, the sum of their volumes is $\mu = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |I_n|$. Clearly, $\mu$ is a non-negative number (it could also be $+\infty$). The infimum of all such sums, which is completely determined by $E$, is called the **Lebesgue outer measure** of $E$, or simply the **outer measure**, denoted as $m^*(E)$:

$$
m^*(E) = \inf\left\{\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} |I_n| \middle| E \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} I_i, I_i \text{are open intervals}\right\}
$$

### Basic Properties of Outer Measure:

1. $m^*(E) \geq 0$; if $E$ is empty, then $m^*(E) = 0$
2. If $A \subset B$, then $m^*(A) \leq m^*(B)$
3. $m^*\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i\right) \leq \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} m^*(A_i)$
4. If the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $d(A, B) > 0$, then $m^*(A \cup B) = m^*(A) + m^*(B)$

# Inner Measure

Let $E$ be a bounded point set in $R^n$ [note that inner measure is defined only for bounded sets], and let $I$ be any open interval containing $E$. Then the **inner measure** of $E$ is defined as:

$$
m_*(E) = |I| - m^*(I \setminus E)
$$

### Basic Properties of Inner Measure:

1. $m_*(E) \geq 0$
2. $m_*(E) \leq m^*(E)$
3. The inner measure can be transformed as follows:

$$
m_*(E) = |I| - m^*(I \setminus E)
$$

$$
= |I| - \inf_{I \setminus E \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} I_i} \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} |I_i|
$$

$$
= \sup_{I \setminus E \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} I_i} \left\{|I| - \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} |I_i|\right\}
$$

---

We expect that when $A \cap B = \emptyset$, we have $m_*(A \cup B) = m_*(A) + m_*(B)$. However, the fourth property of outer measure requires $d(A, B) > 0$ for the outer measure of their union to equal the sum of the outer measures. Notably, this condition cannot be replaced by $A \cap B = \emptyset$. This discrepancy with our intuition indicates that the current definition of measure is not sufficient.

Upon further study, it is found that the sets that violate the additivity of outer measure also violate the additivity of inner measure. **For such sets, the result obtained by approximating the measure from the outside (outer measure) and from the inside (inner measure) is always different, i.e., $m^*(E) > m_*(E)$.** Such sets are called **non-measurable sets**. After excluding such sets, the remaining sets are **measurable sets**, whose measures are additive as expected.

# Lebesgue Measurable Sets

Let $E$ be a **bounded set** in $R^n$. If $m^*(E) = m_*(E)$, we call $E$ a **bounded measurable set**. In this case, the outer (or inner) measure value of $E$ is called the **Lebesgue measure** of $E$, or simply the measure of $E$, denoted as $m(E)$, i.e.,

$$
m(E) = m^*(E) = m_*(E)
$$

Let $E$ be an **unbounded set** in $R^n$. If for any open interval $I$, $E \cap I$ is a bounded measurable set [since the open interval $I$ is bounded, $E \cap I$ is also bounded, allowing the definition of unbounded measurable sets using the definition of bounded measurable sets], then $E$ is called an unbounded measurable set, and $m(E) = m^*(E)$.

**Bounded measurable sets** and **unbounded measurable sets** are collectively referred to as **measurable sets**. Since measure is defined using outer measure, all properties of outer measure apply to measure.

---

The aforementioned definition of measurable sets was given by **Lebesgue**, but it has at least two issues:
- The definitions of bounded and unbounded measurable sets differ.
- Both outer and inner measures are used.

**Carathéodory** provided a unified definition of measurable sets using only outer measure: Let $E$ be a point set in $R^n$. If for any point set $T$, the following condition holds, then $E$ is called a **Lebesgue measurable set**, or simply a **measurable set**. In this case, the outer measure $m^*(E)$ is called the measure of $E$, denoted as $m(E)$:

$$
m^*(T) = m^*(T \cap E) + m^*(T \cap E^c)
$$

---

### Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for a Set $E$ to be Measurable:
1. $E^c$ is measurable.
2. For any $A \subset E$ and $B \subset E^c$, we always have $m^*(A \cup B) = m^*(A) + m^*(B)$.

---

Let $E_1, E_2$ be measurable sets, then:
1. $E_1 \cup E_2$ is a measurable set. Specifically, if $E_1 \cap E_2 = \emptyset$, then for any point set $T$, we always have:

$$
m^*(T \cap (E_1 \cup E_2)) = m^*(T \cap E_1) + m^*(T \cap E_2)
$$

2. $E_1 \cap E_2$ is a measurable set.
3. $E_1 \setminus E_2$ is a measurable set.

---

### Other Properties of Measurable Sets:
- **Countable additivity of measure**: Let $E_i(i = 1,2,\dots)$ be measurable sets, and $E_i \cap E_j = \emptyset (i \neq j)$. Then $\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i$ is measurable, and:

$$
m\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} m(E_i)
$$

- If $E_i(i=1,2,3,\dots)$ are all measurable sets, then $\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i$ is also measurable.
- If $E_i(i=1,2,3,\dots)$ are all measurable sets, then $\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i$ is also measurable.

---

### Common Measurable Sets:
1. Any interval $I$ is a measurable set, and $m(I) = |I|$. Any open set, closed set, and any **Borel set** are measurable sets.
2. Any measurable set in $R^n$ can be expressed as a union of at most countably many pairwise disjoint bounded measurable sets.
