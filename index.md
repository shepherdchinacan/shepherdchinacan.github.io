## Experiences
Meteorological AI Algorithm Engineering Intern at ColorfulClouds Tech.

During my internship, I gained a thorough understanding of the entire AI-powered weather forecasting workflow. This encompassed data transmission and management, model architecture design, utilizing cloud computing platforms for training and deployment, as well as testing and production rollout.

• During the early stage of my internship, I was responsible for developing a project utilizing the HRnet network for radar image denoising.

• Later, I was assigned to develop a rainfall prediction model.




## Skills


### Artificial Intelligence

My journey in the realm of Artificial Intelligence began with a comprehensive study of foundational computer science courses, including computer architecture, operating systems, data structures and algorithms, and high-performance computing. This robust educational background laid the groundwork for my foray into the dynamic field of machine learning. In particular, I have been captivated by the potential of deep learning techniques, which I have applied to address complex scientific challenges within the meteorological domain. My passion for AI is fueled by the endless possibilities it presents for innovation and problem-solving across various industries.

### Meteorology

During my undergraduate studies, I took numerous courses in meteorology, such as dynamic meteorology, principles of meteorology, and climate dynamics, which provided me with a solid foundation in meteorology. Additionally, I have some experience in using atmospheric numerical models, although I may not focus on numerical meteorological models in the future.

### Technical writing

I enjoy writing about technical subjects and I feel I can do a pretty good job about it! My motivation is explaining things in simple and practical terms and thus making things easier for others. *In the future, I hope to write more popular science articles introducing topics such as PANGU, METNET, and Diffusion.*
