## 1. International Summer School on Development and Application of Earth System Model

- **time:** August 26 to August 30, 2024

- **location:** Tsinghua University

A huge thank you to all the amazing professors for their brilliant lectures! I’ve gained so much insight into the exciting ways **AI** is being applied in Earth sciences. Plus, this was my first time serving as a <span style="background:#fff88f">teaching assistant</span> —what an experience! I learned a lot, had some fun, and it’s definitely a milestone I’ll never forget.
